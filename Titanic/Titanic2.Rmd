# Reading Dataset
```{r}
titanic <- read.csv("Titanic Data.csv")
View(titanic)
```

# Use R to create a table showing the average age of the survivors and the average age of the people who died.
```{r}
mytable <- aggregate(titanic$Age , by=list(titanic$Survived) ,mean)
mytable
```

# Use R to run a t-test to test the following hypothesis:
  H2: The Titanic survivors were younger than the passengers who died.
```{r}
t.test(Age ~ Survived ,data=titanic)
```

# Conclusion
Since, the p-value is < 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis. And conclude that,"The Titanic survivors were younger than the passengers who died".
